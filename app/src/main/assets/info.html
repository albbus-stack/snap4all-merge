        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            To finalize the installation of Snap4all the device must be
            restarted. Once restarted, the new features will be shown in the
            start screen. Without restarting you can only use the Termux console
            or read this info page. If the Termux console is disabled please
            check your internet connection, then close and reopen the app before
            restarting.
            <br />
            There are three main section of this app:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Termux console</b>: this is the Termux console of your device
                (since you cannot install this app and the official Termux app
                at the same time). Do your own research and use at your own
                risk.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Iot app editor</b>: opens the iot app editor of your local
                Node-RED server where you can build your own iot app.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Iot app dashboard</b>: opens the iot app dashboard of your
                local server where you can monitor your own iot app after having
                configured it properly following the
                <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/">Node-RED documentation</a>.
                You can also use this to display the contents of a
                <a href="https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard"
                    >node-red-dashboard</a
                >
                app.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Obviously the iot app editor and dashboard buttons are enabled only
            after the Node-RED server starts up.
            <br />
            <i
                ><b>*</b> is possible that a toast stating "starting node-red"
                is shown several times, this is normal since the operating
                system closes the server following Android's battery-saving
                policy, the termux-boot service will try to restart it as soon
                as it is closed.</i
            >
        </p>
        <h2>Example usage</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Install the application.</li>
            <li>Reboot your phone.</li>
            <li>Open the application.</li>
            <li>
                Open the iot app editor and enjoy the full Node-RED framework on
                your phone.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            This Mobile application Snap4All has been developed to realize
            IOT/IOE edge devices for smart city and industry 4.0 applications,
            by <a href="https://www.disit.org">DISIT Lab</a> for
            <a href="https://www.km4city.org">Km4City</a> and
            <a href="https://www.snap4city.org">Snap4City</a>.
            <br />
            The IOT applications on Snap4All can exploit the sensors of your
            mobile phone and may have a local user interface as the local
            dashboard. They may work as a standalone solution for sending
            messages to other IOT devices or IOT brokers connected to Snap4All,
            Snap4City or other platforms.
            <br />
            This app can be installed on any android device, and allows you to
            have an IOT application (a Node-RED server) running on your mobile
            phone. The IOT application can be also produced into the mobile
            applications as well as developed on other facilities and imported.
            <br />
            The IOT application and corresponding editor are based on Node-RED
            of the JS Foundation licensed under

            Some of the innovative features that can be exploited into IOT
            applications are provided by the Snap4City platform and can be
            mounted on any other Node-RED installation. The Snap4City platform
            is completely open source.
            <br />
            In addition, some of the features, as the

                >Termux nodes</a
            >, in Node-RED are specific for the android platform. This mobile
            app has been developed using Termux and the Termux API which is also
