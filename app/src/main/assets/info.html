        <h2>Installation</h2>

        <p>
            On the first app load the Termux base packages will be installed, this usually takes around 20 seconds after which the console button in the home page will be activated.
            <br /><br />
            Once the Termux console has finished installing, you will be asked to grant the app the
            permission to run in the background. This is necessary for the app to serve Node-RED at all times. 
            <br /><br />
            After that, the app will download Node-RED along with its <a href="#node-red-packages">additional plugins</a> and setup them. This is the longest part of the installation since it can take up to 5 minutes depending on your phone and network speed.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>
            To finalize the installation of Snap4all the device must be
            restarted. Once restarted, the new features will be shown in the
            start screen. Without restarting you can only use the Termux console
            or read this info page. If the Termux console is disabled please
            check your internet connection, then close and reopen the app before
            restarting.

            <br /><br />
            The app consists of the following main sections:

            <h4>Termux console</h4>
            This is the Termux console of your device in which you can run any
            command. since you cannot install this app and the official Termux
            app at the same time). Do your own research and use at your own
            risk.

            <br /><br />
            <h4>IoT app editor</h4>
            Opens the IoT app editor of your local Node-RED server where you can
            build your own IoT app using the preinstalled <a href="#node-red-packages">utility packages</a> for
            Termux and Snap4All.

            <br /><br />
            <h4>IoT app dashboard</h4>
            Opens the IoT app dashboard of your local server where you can
            monitor your IoT app after having configured it properly following
            the
            <a href="https://nodered.org/docs/">Node-RED documentation</a>. We
            recommend you to use this to display the contents of a
            <a href="https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard"
                >Node-RED dashboard</a
            >
            app since it's an included package.
            
            <br /><br />
            <i>
                <b>+</b> it's likely that a "starting node-red" toast is shown
                several times, this is normal since the operating system closes
                the server following Android's battery-saving policy, the
                Termux:Boot service will try to restart it as soon as possible.
            </i>
        </p>


        <h2>Installed Packages</h2>
        <p>
            <h4>apt - Build utilities</h4>
            cmake, make, clang, git, openssh, coreutils, nodejs, nano

            <br /><br />
            <h4 id="node-red-packages">npm - Node-RED packages</h4>
            node-red, node-red-contrib-termux-api, node-red-dashboard, node-red-contrib-snap4city-user
        </p>

        <h2>Credits</h2>

        <p>
            This app is based on the <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a> app by Fredrik Fornwall and the
            <a href="https://nodered.org/">Node-RED</a> app by IBM. The app has been developed under the Snap4City project of the University of Florence, you can read more about who is involved on the <a href="https://www.snap4city.org/214">Snap4City site</a>. 
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

        <p>
            This Mobile application Snap4All has been developed to realize
            IOT/IOE edge devices for smart city and industry 4.0 applications,
            by <a href="https://www.disit.org">DISIT Lab</a> for
            <a href="https://www.km4city.org">Km4City</a> and
            <a href="https://www.snap4city.org">Snap4City</a>.
            <br />
            The IOT applications on Snap4All can exploit the sensors of your
            mobile phone and may have a local user interface as the local
            dashboard. They may work as a standalone solution for sending
            messages to other IOT devices or IOT brokers connected to Snap4All,
            Snap4City or other platforms.
            <br />
            This app can be installed on any android device, and allows you to
            have an IOT application (a Node-RED server) running on your mobile
            phone. The IOT application can be also produced into the mobile
            applications as well as developed on other facilities and imported.
            <br />
            The IOT application and corresponding editor are based on Node-RED
            of the JS Foundation licensed under
            <a href="https://github.com/node-red/node-red/blob/master/LICENSE"

            <br />
            Some of the innovative features that can be exploited into IOT
            applications are provided by the Snap4City platform and can be
            mounted on any other Node-RED installation. The Snap4City platform
            is completely open source.
            <br />
            In addition, some of the features, as the

                >Termux nodes</a
            >, in Node-RED are specific for the android platform. This mobile
            app has been developed using Termux and the Termux API which is also
